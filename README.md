# oagamepack_scripts
Script to generate the Radiant ent file from csv files.

Requires python3 and pandas.
I had hoped to only use pure python without libraries but the build in csv reader was not good enough.


./create_ent.py will print the ent file to stdout.

There are no keys at the moment. Only descriptions from the source.

Notes:
The panda package is called python3-pandas in Ubuntu.
